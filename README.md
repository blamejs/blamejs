# blamejs

**The Node framework that owns its stack.**

One install. One upgrade path. One place to look when something breaks — no blame to pass between forty transitive dependencies you didn't choose.

## Why blamejs

The modern Node app is a 1,200-package supply-chain liability with no LTS calendar, no curator, and no accountability. Frameworks peer-depend their internals onto you and call it modularity. blamejs takes the opposite stance:

- **Vendored standard library.** Auth, sessions, jobs, mail, storage, crypto, ORM, templating — bundled with the framework, not hunted on npm. Your `package.json` has one entry.
- **Security as a default, not a config flag.** Post-quantum-aware crypto envelopes, sealed-by-default storage, server-rendered output, CSRF/origin/bot defenses wired in from line zero.
- **Server-rendering first.** HTML out of the box; client JS is opt-in islands, not the foundation.
- **A real LTS calendar.** Major versions on a published cadence with documented deprecation windows. No silent semver-major surprises in transitive deps.

## Status

Early. The repo currently exists to claim the name and stake the principles. No public API yet — design phase.

## Why "blamejs"

Because when something breaks, `blame` should know exactly where it lives. We own the stack so you don't have to chase the fault across an ecosystem.

## License

TBD — likely permissive (MIT or Apache-2.0) for the framework itself.
