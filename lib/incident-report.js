 * @title  Incident Report
 * @slug   incident-report
 *
 * @intro
 *   Staged incident reporting against the clock a regime imposes. An
 *   incident is opened with the regime it falls under, and the deadlines for
 *   the initial, intermediate and final reports follow from that: four hours
 *   for a DORA initial notification, twenty-four for GDPR, NIS2, the CRA and
 *   HIPAA, seventy-two hours for every intermediate report, and a final
 *   report at fourteen, thirty or sixty days depending on the regime.
 *
 *   One incident often reports under more than one regime, which is why the
 *   deadlines belong to the incident rather than the deployment. The regime
 *   is named when the incident is opened, so an operator is not computing
 *   dates during an incident.
 *
 *   Every deadline is measured from <code>detectedAt</code>, the moment the
 *   organization became aware, and not from the moment the incident was
 *   recorded. That is what the regimes say, and it means an incident entered
 *   two hours after detection already has two hours gone.
 *
 *   The deadline clock watches the open incidents and notifies as each
 *   deadline approaches, at half, three quarters and nine tenths of the
 *   window by default. It stops tracking an incident once its submission is
 *   acknowledged, so what remains is what is still outstanding.
 *
 * @card
 *   Staged incident reporting on each regime's own clock, from DORA's
 *   four-hour initial notification to a sixty-day HIPAA final report, with a
 *   deadline watcher that notifies before each window closes.

 *
 * Open an incident register. The returned object answers `open`,
 * `recordInitial`, `recordIntermediate`, `recordFinal`, `get`, `list` and
 * `status`.
 *
 * `status()` answers across the register, not per incident: `total`, how many
 * are `open` and `closed`, and a `late` count for each of the three stages.
 * Which stage one incident owes next comes from `get(id)`.
 *
 * `open(spec)` requires two fields. `regime` decides the deadlines: `gdpr`,
 * `nis2`, `dora`, `cra` and `hipaa` are known, and any other string is
 * accepted and takes the default twenty-four hour, seventy-two hour and
 * thirty-day windows; an empty or non-string one raises
 * `incident-report/bad-regime`, because an incident with no regime has no
 * deadline. `detectedAt` must be a finite epoch-millisecond timestamp and has
 * no default (`incident-report/bad-detected-at`): every deadline is computed
 * from it, so a guessed value would produce the wrong one.
 *
 * `scope`, `summary` and `impact` are recorded when given and stored as
 * `null` otherwise. They are what the filings are written from, so an incident
 * opened without them has a deadline and nothing to report against it.
 *
 * `deadlines` overrides any of the three windows, per register.
 *
 * `persist` is an outbound sink, not storage the register reads back: it is
 * called with each record as it is written, and `create` always starts empty.
 * There is no restoration path, and `open` is not one, since it mints a new
 * id, empties `stages` and clears `closedAt`: replaying a persisted record
 * through it would turn a filed incident back into an outstanding one.
 *
 * So a restart loses `get`, `list`, `status` and the deadline clock for every
 * incident opened before it. An incident usually outlasts the process
 * handling it, so treat what `persist` receives as the record of what
 * happened, and read it with the deployment's own tooling rather than
 * expecting the register to come back.
 *
 * `onStage` is called as each stage is recorded, with one event object
 * carrying `incidentId`, `stage`, `dueBy`, `late` and `regime`, plus `fields`,
 * the payload that stage was recorded with. This is where a deployment wires
 * its own notification; `late` is the field worth routing on.
 *
 * A stage keeps a structured copy of the fields it was filed with, not the
 * object that was passed, so mutating or reusing that object afterwards does
 * not change what the record says was filed. `onStage` still receives the
 * object as given.
 *
 * The copy holds the data rather than the classes around it. Dates, Maps, Sets
 * and cycles survive; a `Buffer` comes back as a `Uint8Array` over the same
 * bytes, and a value whose `toJSON` lives on its prototype comes back as a
 * plain object, so serializing the record can differ from serializing what was
 * passed. Pass plain data for anything a filing will be rendered from.
 *
 * A payload holding something that cannot be copied at all, such as a
 * function, is kept by reference instead of being emptied, since losing the
 * filing's contents is worse than sharing the object.
 *
 * `audit` is `false` to stay silent, `true` or omitted for the framework
 * chain, or a configuration object such as `{ sink: yourAudit }` to send the
 * events somewhere else. Anything else raises `incident-report/bad-opt`: a
 * string or a number was read as "not false" and left the events on while the
 * configuration said they were off.
 *
 * @opts
 *   deadlines: object,   // initial / intermediate / final, in ms
 *   onStage:   object,   // function (event) per stage; see the prose for its fields
 *   persist:   object,   // function (record) per write; not read back
 *   now:       object,   // function returning epoch ms; for tests
 *   audit:     boolean,  // false silences the audit events
 *

 *
 * Watch open incidents and notify before each reporting deadline. The clock
 * answers `track`, `untrack`, `acknowledgeSubmission`, `tick`, `start`, `stop`
 * and `status`.
 *
 * `track(record)` starts watching one incident. Each tick measures how much of
 * the window has elapsed and notifies for the highest threshold that has been
 * crossed and not yet fired, once per threshold per stage: half, three
 * quarters and nine tenths of the window by default. A tick that jumps past
 * more than one threshold therefore sends one alert naming the highest, not
 * one per threshold. A threshold outside the open interval between 0 and 1
 * raises `incident-report/bad-threshold`, since a threshold at 0 fires
 * immediately and one at 1 fires only once the deadline has passed.
 *
 * `acknowledgeSubmission` is how an incident stops being chased: once the
 * stage is submitted, its deadline no longer raises an alert.
 * `autoStart` is on, so the clock begins ticking every minute when it is
 * created; `tick()` drives it by hand instead, which is how it is tested.
 * `status()` answers `{ tracked, running, intervalMs }`, which is the clock's
 * own state rather than any incident's.
 *
 * `autoStart` and `audit` must be booleans, raising
 * `incident-report/bad-opt` otherwise. Anything else was read as "not false",
 * so a typo left the timer running and the audit events on while the
 * configuration said they were off.
 *
 * @opts
 *   notify:             object,   // object with send(message); receives each alert
 *   approachThresholds: array,    // fractions in (0,1); default [0.5, 0.75, 0.9]
 *   intervalMs:         number,   // default 1 minute
 *   autoStart:          boolean,  // false leaves it to tick() or start()
